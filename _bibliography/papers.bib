   abstract = {Circadian rhythms in adult eclosion of Drosophila are postulated to be regulated by a pair of coupled oscillators: one is the master clock that is light sensitive and temperature compensated and the other that is a slave oscillator whose period is temperature sensitive and whose phase is reflected in the overt behavior. Within this framework, we reasoned that in populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have been artificially selected for highly divergent phases of eclosion rhythm, there may be changes in this network of the master-slave oscillator system, via changes in the temperature-sensitive oscillator and/or the coupling of the light- and temperature-sensitive oscillators. We used light/dark cycles in conjunction with different constant ambient temperatures and 2 different amplitudes of temperature cycles in an overall cool or warm temperature and analyzed phases, gate width, and normalized amplitude of the rhythms in each of these conditions. We found that the populations selected for eclosion in the morning (early flies) do not vary their phases with change in temperature regimes, whereas the populations selected for eclosion in the evening (late flies) show phase lability of up to ~5 h. Our results imply a genetic correlation between timing of behavior and temperature sensitivity of the circadian clock.},

   abstract = {A major limitation in the bio-medical sector is the availability of materials suitable for bone tissue engineering using stem cells and methodology converting the stochastic biological events towards definitive as well as efficient bio-mineralization. We show that osteoblasts and Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Pools (BM-MSCP) express TRPM8, a Ca2+-ion channel critical for bone-mineralization. TRPM8 inhibition triggers up-regulation of key osteogenesis factors; and increases mineralization by osteoblasts. We utilized CMT:HEMA, a carbohydrate polymer-based hydrogel that has nanofiber-like structure suitable for optimum delivery of TRPM8-specific activators or inhibitors. This hydrogel is ideal for proper adhesion, growth, and differentiation of osteoblast cell lines, primary osteoblasts, and BM-MSCP. CMT:HEMA coated with AMTB (TRPM8 inhibitor) induces differentiation of BM-MSCP into osteoblasts and subsequent mineralization in a dose-dependent manner. Prolonged and optimum inhibition of TRPM8 by AMTB released from the gels results in upregulation of osteogenic markers. We propose that AMTB-coated CMT:HEMA can be used as a tunable surface for bone tissue engineering. These findings may have broad implications in different bio-medical sectors.},

   abstract = {Different ion channels present in the osteoblast regulate the cellular functions including bio-mineralization, a process that is a highly stochastic event. Cellular events and molecular signaling involved in such process is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that TRPV4, a mechanosensitive ion channel is endogenously present in an osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) and in primary osteoblasts. Pharmacological activation of TRPV4 enhanced intracellular Ca(2+)-level, expression of osteoblast-specific genes and caused increased bio-mineralization. TRPV4 activation also affects mitochondrial Ca(2+)-levels and mitochondrial metabolisms. We further demonstrate that different point mutants of TRPV4 induce different mitochondrial morphology and have different levels of mitochondrial translocation, collectively suggesting that TRPV4-mutation-induced bone disorders and other channelopathies are mostly due to mitochondrial abnormalities. These findings may have broad biomedical implications.},

   abstract = {Chronobiologists and sleep researchers often need to estimate various rhythm and sleep parameters from locomotor activity data from different organisms. The available open-source or expensive paid tools do not offer consolidated analysis and visualization options in one bundle, are often cumbersome for users unfamiliar with coding, offer very low customization options, introduce sources of human errors by requiring users to manually pick period and power values from periodogram plots, and do not generate reproducible reports. We present VANESSA, a family of cross-platform apps written in R, which, in our opinion, have several advantages compared with available tools-(a) open-source; (b) automatic period-power detection; (c) time-series filtering and smoothing; (d) high-resolution publication-quality figures with dynamic coloring, resizing, and light/dark shading; (e) reproducible code-report generation; (f) analysis and visualization of multiple monitor files, defining genotypes and replicates separately; and (g) sleep profile analysis, various sleep parameter estimations, quantification, bout analysis, and latency analysis. The current version of the app is for data acquired through Drosophila Activity Monitors (DAM, TriKinetics) but can be easily extended to that from other data acquisition systems and from other organisms. We will continue to develop VANESSA with more useful features and version control will be done via archiving versions with significant changes on GitHub (https://github.com/orijitghosh/VANESSA-DAM) and Zenodo.},

   abstract = {Transient Receptor Potential cation channel, subfamily Melastatin, member 8 (TRPM8) is involved in detection of cold temperature, different noxious compounds and in execution of thermo- as well as chemo-sensitive responses at cellular levels. Here we explored the molecular evolution of TRPM8 by analyzing sequences from various species. We elucidate that several regions of TRPM8 had different levels of selection pressure but the 4th-5th transmembrane regions remain highly conserved. Analysis of synteny suggests that since vertebrate origin, TRPM8 gene is linked with SPP2, a bone morphogen. TRPM8, especially the N-terminal region of it, seems to be highly variable in human population. We found 16,656 TRPM8 variants in 1092 human genomes with top variations being SNPs, insertions and deletions. A total of 692 missense mutations are also mapped to human TRPM8 protein of which 509 seem to be delateroiours in nature as supported by Polyphen V2, SIFT and Grantham deviation score. Using a highly specific antibody, we demonstrate that TRPM8 is expressed endogenously in the testis of rat and sperm cells of different vertebrates ranging from fish to higher mammals. We hypothesize that TRPM8 had emerged during vertebrate evolution (ca 450 MYA). We propose that expression of TRPM8 in sperm cell and its role in regulating sperm function are important factors that have guided its molecular evolution, and that these understandings may have medical importance.},

   abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the full mutation in the FMR1 gene on the Xq27.3 chromosome region. It is the most common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and inherited intellectual disability (ID). Besides ASD and ID and other symptoms, individuals with FXS may exhibit sleep problems and impairment of circadian rhythm (CR). The Drosophila melanogaster models of FXS, such as dFMR1(B55), represent excellent models for research in the FXS field. During this study, sleep patterns and CR in dFMR1(B55) mutants were analyzed, using a new platform based on continuous high-resolution videography integrated with a highly-customized version of an open-source software. This methodology provides more sensitive results, which could be crucial for all further research in this model of fruit flies. The study revealed that dFMR1(B55) male mutants sleep more and can be considered weak rhythmic flies rather than totally arrhythmic and present a good alternative animal model of genetic disorder, which includes impairment of CR and sleep behavior. The combination of affordable videography and software used in the current study is a significant improvement over previous methods and will enable broader adaptation of such high-resolution behavior monitoring methods.},

   abstract = {TRPV1 is a thermo-sensitive ion channel involved in neurosensory and other physiological functions. The trans-membrane helices of TRPV1 undergo quick and complex conformational changes governed by thermodynamic parameters and membrane components leading to channel opening. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such events are poorly understood. Here we analysed the molecular evolution of TRPV1 at the lipid-water-interface region (LWI), typically defined as a layer of 6 A thickness on each side of the membrane with less availability of free water. Amino acids demarcating the end of the trans-membrane helices are highly conserved. Residues present in the inner leaflet are more conserved and have been preferentially selected over others. Amino acids with snorkeling properties (Arginine and Tyrosine) undergo specific selection during the vertebrate evolution in a cholesterol-dependent and/or body temperature manner. Results suggest that H-bond formation between the OH- group of cholesterol and side chain of Arg557 or Arg575 at the inner leaflet is a critical parameter that can regulate channel functions. Different LWI mutants of TRPV1 have altered membrane localization and deficient colocalization with lipid raft markers. These findings may help to understand the lipid-protein interactions, and molecular basis of different neuronal functions. Such findings may have broad importance in the context of differential sensory responses, pathophysiologies, and application of pharmacological drugs such as anaesthetics acting on TRPVs.},

   abstract = {TRPA1 is a non-selective cation channel originated in invertebrates. The genomic locus containing TRPA1 gene remains highly conserved and retained in all vertebrates. TRPA1 gene is evolutionarily selected, yet maintained as a highly diverged protein. Throughout the vertebrate evolution, the extracellular loops of TRPA1 become most diverged indicating that TRPA1 may be involved in detecting large spectrum and uncertain stimulus which is critical for adaptive benefit. We tested the expression of TRPA1 in mature sperm from different vertebrates. This is the first report demonstrating that TRPA1 is expressed endogenously in mature spermatozoa of multiple species representing entire vertebrate phyla. However, its specific localization within sperm remains species-specific. Accordingly, we report that in rodents TRPA1 expression correlates with different stages of spermatogenesis. We propose that presence of endogenous TRPA1 in testes and in mature sperm provides reproductive benefit.},

Lack of suitable surface which promotes growth of both osteogenic and nonosteogenic cells is a major limitation. Here a novel biomaterial is reported that is synthesized from natural polysaccharide, namely, tamarind kernel polysaccharide (TKP), which is grafted with hydrophilic acrylic acid (AA) by radical polymerization. Modification in surface functionality removes unwanted proteins and alters hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. TKP-AA is suitable for the growth of different nonosteogenic and osteogenic cells. This material is suitable for osteoblasts and promotes in vitro mineralization and differentiation without the addition of exogenous growth factors. TKP-AA can be used for the growth of mesenchymal stem cell-derived osteoblasts. It is suggested that TKP-AA can potentially be used as a scaffold for diverse cell types and particularly for bone tissue engineering at low cost.},
