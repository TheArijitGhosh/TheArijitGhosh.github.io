Currently I am a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the [Laboratory of Systems Genetics, SBC, NHLBI at Bethesda, Maryland](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/systems-genetics#Meet-the-Team). I study the interaction between the circadian clock and sleep genetic networks, and how these interactions shape various behavior and physiological responses. During my PhD, I worked on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, specifically timing of a behavior at the [Chronobiology and Behavioural Neurogenetics Laboratory](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/sheeba), JNCASR. My studies use diverse methodologies - from statistical modeling of behavior to next-generation sequencing. Previously, I have also worked on thermo-sensitive Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels and their role in osteogenesis, using rodent models, primary bone cells, pharmacological modulators, and molecular dynamics during my masters studies at [NISER](https://www.niser.ac.in/).

Apart from my work in the lab, I am a leisure photographer, connoisseur of sci-fi (old and new) and good food!
